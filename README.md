# React Calculator

## Overview

The simple-react-calculator is a straightforward calculator application built with React. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in a user-friendly web interface. This documentation provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the project.

## Library Choice: React

I chose to build the Simple React Calculator using the React library due to its numerous advantages for building user interfaces. React is widely adopted in the web development community for its simplicity, component-based architecture, and efficient rendering. Here are a few reasons why React was a suitable choice for this project:

* Component Reusability: React's component-based architecture allows us to create reusable UI components, making it easy to maintain and scale the application as needed.

* Virtual DOM: React's use of a virtual DOM minimizes browser manipulation, resulting in improved performance and a smoother user experience.

* Large Ecosystem: React has a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support, which accelerates development and problem-solving.

* Declarative Syntax: React's declarative syntax makes it easier to understand and reason about the application's behavior, making development more efficient.

By using React, we've aimed to create an intuitive and responsive calculator application that provides a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Simple React Calculator on your local development environment.

**1. Clone the Repository**

Use the following commands to clone the project's repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mulekotd/react-calculator.git

cd react-calculator
```

**2.  Install Dependencies**

Install the project's dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Run the Project**

Start the development server to run the Simple React Calculator:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The calculator should now be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:5173/react-calculator/.

## Usage

Once the project is up and running, you can use the [Simple React Calculator](https://mulekotd.github.io/react-calculator/) to perform calculations. Here are some basic instructions on how to use it:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173/simple-react-calculator/ (or the appropriate address if you modified the configuration).

2. The calculator interface should be displayed, allowing you to enter numbers and perform calculations.

3. Use the buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to perform arithmetic operations.

4. Enter numbers using the numeric keypad on the interface.

5. Click the "=" button to see the result of the calculation.

6. To clear the input or result, use the "C" button.

7. Enjoy using the Simple React Calculator for your basic arithmetic needs.
